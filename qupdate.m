function qnew = qupdate(q, vel, dt)
    % Inputs:
    % q is the configuration vector (x, y, theta) in units of metres and radians
    % vel is the velocity vector (vleft, vright) each in the range -100 to +100
    % dt is the length of the integration timestep in units of seconds
    % Return:
    % qnew is the new configuration vector vector (x, y, theta) in units of metres and radians at the
    % end of the time interval.
    qd = qdot(q, vel);
    qnew = q+(qd.*dt);
